# APP_1-TODO_LIST_APP
This is App 1 on Ardit Sulce's course "Learn Python in 60 days. Build 20 apps". This app will allow you to add, complete, and edit a task. You can also exit the program with the show option in the command-line interface program.
**The command line interface program** is the least user-friendly version of all, you will get a prompt to give your command. It will process and will show only if you ask it to.
**The GUI program** replaces the prompt with buttons and labels. You can also see the time. This is more user-friendly but you need to install an executable file for it to work.
**The Web interface program** is the most user-friendly as you can visit it with your browser. All you need to do is to remember the URL. You don't need buttons anymore as you will get checkboxes to replace them.
